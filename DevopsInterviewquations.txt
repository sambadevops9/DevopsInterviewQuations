Best DevOps Interview Questions and
 Answers

Q1) what is DevOps?
By the name DevOps, it’s very clear that it’s a collaboration of Development as well as Operations. But one should know that DevOps is not a tool, or software or framework, DevOps is a Combination of Tools which helps for the automation of the whole infrastructure.
DevOps is basically an implementation of Agile methodology on the Development side as well as Operations side.

Q2) why do we need DevOps?
To fulfil the need of delivering more and faster and better application to meet more and more demands of users, we need DevOps. DevOps helps deployment to happen really fast compared to any other traditional tools.

Q3) Mention the key aspects or principle behind DevOps?
The key aspects or principle behind DevOps is:
• Infrastructure as a Code
• Continuous Integration
• Continuous Deployment
• Automation
• Continuous Monitoring
• Security

Q4) List out some of the popular tools for DevOps?
• Git
• Jenkins
• Ansible
• Puppet
• Nagios
• Docker
• ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Q5) what is a version control system?
Version Control System (VCS) is a software that helps software developers to work together and maintain a complete history of their work.
Some of the feature of VCS as follows:
• Allow developers to wok simultaneously
• Does not allow overwriting on each other changes.
• Maintain the history of every version.
There are two types of Version Control Systems:
1. Central Version Control System, Ex: Git, Bitbucket
2. Distributed/Decentralized Version Control System, Ex: SVN

Q6) What is Git and explain the difference between Git and SVN?
Git is a source code management (SCM) tool which handles small as well as large projects with efficiency. It is basically used to store our repositories in remote server such as GitHub.
      GIT SVN
Git is a Decentralized Version Control Tool SVN is a Centralized Version Control Tool
Git contains the local repo as well as the full history of the whole project on all the developers hard drive, so if there is a server outage , you can easily do recovery from your team mates local git repo. SVN relies only on the central server to store all the versions of the project file
Push and pull operations are fast Push and pull operations are slower compared to Git
It belongs to 3rd generation Version Control Tool It belongs to 2nd generation Version Control tools
Client nodes can share the entire repositories on their local system Version history is stored on server-side repository
Commits can be done offline too Commits can be done only online
Work are shared automatically by commit Nothing is shared automatically

Q7) what language is used in Git?
Git is written in C language, and since its written in C language its very fast and reduces the overhead of runtimes.

Q8) what is SubGit?
SubGit is a tool for migrating SVN to Git. It creates a writable Git mirror of a local or remote Subversion repository and uses both Subversion and Git if you like.

Q9) how can you clone a Git repository via Jenkins?
First, we must enter the e-mail and user name for your Jenkins system, then switch into your job directory and execute the “git config” command.

Q10)What are the Advantages of Ansible?
• Agentless, it doesn’t require any extra package/daemons to be installed
• Very low overhead
• Good performance
• Idempotent
• Very Easy to learn
• Declarative not procedural

Q11) what’s the use of Ansible?
Ansible is mainly used in IT infrastructure to manage or deploy applications to remote nodes. Let’s say we want to deploy one application in 100’s of nodes by just executing one command, then Ansible is the one actually coming into the picture but should have some knowledge on Ansible script to understand or execute the same.

Q12) what’s the difference between Ansible Playbook and Roles?
        Roles    Playbooks
Roles are reusable subsets of a play. Playbooks contain Plays.
A set of tasks for accomplishing certain role. Mapps among hosts and roles.
Example: common, webservers. Example: site.yml, fooservers.yml, webservers.yml.

 Q13) How do I see a list of all the ansible_ variables?
Ansible by default gathers “facts” about the machines, and these facts can be accessed in Playbooks and in templates. To see a list of all the facts that are available about a machine, you can run the “setup” module as an ad-hoc action:
Ansible -m setup hostname
This will print out a dictionary of all the facts that are available for that particular host.

Q14) what is Docker?
Docker is a containerization technology that packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of Containers to ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment.

Q15) what is Docker image?
Docker image is the source of Docker container. Or in other words, Docker images are used to create containers.

Q16) what is Docker Container?
Docker Container is the running instance of Docker Image.

Q17) Can we consider DevOps as Agile methodology?
Of Course, we can!! The only difference between agile methodology and DevOps is that, agile methodology is implemented only for development section and DevOps implements agility on both development as well as operations section.

 Q18) what are the advantages of using Git?
1. Data redundancy and replication
2. High availability
3. Only one. git directory per repository
4. Superior disk utilization and network performance

I ignore alphabet difference V accept this value
ex) ls | grep -i docker
Dockerfile
docker.tar.gz
ls | grep -v docker
Desktop
Dockerfile
Documents
Downloads
You can’t see anything with name docker.tar.gz

Q21) How can you define particular space to the file
This feature is generally used to give the swap space to the server. Lets say in below machine I have to create swap space of 1GB then,
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1G count=1

 Q22) what is concept of sudo in linux?
Sudo(superuser do) is a utility for UNIX- and Linux-based systems that provides an     efficient way to give specific users permission to use specific system commands at the root (most powerful) level of the system.

 Q23) what is a Jenkins Pipeline?

 Q26) what are the tools used for docker networking?
For docker networking we generally use kubernets and docker swarm.

 Q27) what is docker compose?
Lets say you want to run multiple docker container, at that time you have to create the docker compose file and type the command docker-compose up. It will run all the containers mentioned in docker compose file.

Q28) What is Scrum?
Scrum is basically used to divide your complex software and product development task into smaller chunks, using iterations and incremental practises. Each iteration is of two weeks. Scrum consists of three roles: Product owner, scrum master and Team

Q29) What does the commit object contain?
Commit object contain the following components:
It contains a set of files, representing the state of a project at a given point of time reference to parent commit objects
An SHAI name, a 40-character string that uniquely identifies the commit object (also called as hash).

Q30) Explain the difference between git pull and git fetch?
Git pull command basically pulls any new changes or commits from a branch from your central repository and updates your target branch in your local repository.
Git fetch is also used for the same purpose, but its slightly different form Git pull. When you trigger a git fetch, it pulls all new commits from the desired branch and stores it in a new branch in your local repository. If we want to reflect these changes in your target branch, git fetch must be followed with a git merge. Our target branch will only be updated after merging the target branch and fetched branch. Just to make it easy for us, remember the equation below:
Git pull = git fetch + git merge

Q31) How do we know in Git if a branch has already been merged into master?
git branch –merged
The above command lists the branches that have been merged into the current branch.
git branch –no-merged
this command lists the branches that have not been merged.

Q32) What is ‘Staging Area’ or ‘Index’ in GIT?
Before committing a file, it must be formatted and reviewed in an intermediate area known as ‘Staging Area’ or ‘Indexing Area’.
#git add <file_name>

Q33) What is Git Stash?
Let’s say you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for some time to work on something else. The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of your half-done work just, so you can get back to this point later. The answer to this issue is Git stash.
Git Stashing takes your working directory that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.

Q34) What is Git stash drop?
Git ‘stash drop’ command is basically used to remove the stashed item. It will basically remove the last added stash item by default, and it can also remove a specific item if you include it as an argument.
I have provided an example below:
If you want to remove any particular stash item from the list of stashed items you can use the below commands:
git stash list: It will display the list of stashed items as follows:
stash@{0}: WIP on master: 049d080 added the index file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: c265351 Revert “added files”
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 13d80a5 added number to log

Q35) What is the function of ‘git config’?
Git uses our username to associate commits with an identity. The git config command can be used to change our Git configuration, including your username.
Suppose you want to give a username and email id to associate commit with an identity so that you can know who has made a commit. For that I will use:
git config –global user.name “Your Name”: This command will add your username.
git config –global user.email “Your E-mail Address”: This command will add your email id.

Q36) How can you create a repository in Git?
To create a repository, you must create a directory for the project if it does not exist, then run command “git init”. By running this command .git directory will be created inside the project directory.

Q37) Describe the branching strategies you have used?
Generally, they ask this question to understand your branching knowledge
Feature branching
This model keeps all the changes for a feature inside of a branch. When the feature branch is fully tested and validated by automated tests, the branch is then merged into master.
Task branching
In this task branching model each task is implemented on its own branch with the task key included in the branch name. It is quite easy to see which code implements which task, just look for the task key in the branch name.
Release branching
Once the develop branch has acquired enough features for a release, then we can clone that branch to form a Release branch. Creating this release branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this point, only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch. Once it’s ready to ship, the release gets merged into master and then tagged with a version number. In addition, it should be merged back into develop branch, which may have progressed since the release was initiated earlier.

Q38) What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open source continuous integration tool which is written in Java language. It keeps a track on version control system and to initiate and monitor a build system if any changes occur. It monitors the whole process and provides reports and notifications to alert the concern team.

Q39) What is the difference between Maven, Ant and Jenkins?
Maven and Ant are Build Technologies whereas Jenkins is a continuous integration(CI/CD) tool.

Q40) Explain what is continuous integration?

Using hostvars method we can access and add the variables like below
{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname][‘ansible_’ + which_interface][‘ipv4’][‘address’] }}

Q82) What is Infrastructure as Code?
Where the Configuration of any servers or tool chain or application stack required for an association can be made into progressively elucidating dimension of code and that can be utilized for provisioning and overseeing foundation components like Virtual Machine, Software, Network Elements, however it varies from contents utilizing any language, where they are a progression of static advances coded, where Version control can be utilized so as to follow condition changes .
Precedent Tools are Ansible, Terraform.

Q83) What are the zones the Version control can acquaint with get proficient DevOps practice?
A clearly fundamental region of Version Control is Source code the executives, Where each engineer code ought to be pushed to a typical storehouse for keeping up assemble and discharge in CI/CD pipelines.
Another territory can be Version control For Administrators when they use Infrastructure as A Code (IAC) apparatuses and rehearses for keeping up The Environment setup.
Another Area of Version Control framework Can be Artifactory Management Using Repositories like Nexus and DockerHub

Q84) Why Opensource apparatuses support DevOps?
Opensource devices dominatingly utilized by any association which is adjusting (or) embraced DevOps pipelines in light of the fact that devops accompanied an attention on robotization in different parts of association manufacture and discharge and change the executives and furthermore framework the board zones.
So creating or utilizing a solitary apparatus is unthinkable and furthermore everything is fundamentally an experimentation period of advancement and furthermore coordinated chops down the advantage of building up a solitary device , so opensource devices were accessible available practically spares each reason and furthermore gives association a choice to assess the device dependent on their need.

Q85) What is the distinction among Ansible and chef(or) manikin?
Ansible is Agentless design the board device, where manikin or gourmet expert needs operator should be kept running on the specialist hub and culinary specialist or manikin depends on draw demonstrate, where your cookbook or show for gourmet expert and manikin separately from the ace will be pulled by the operator and ansible uses ssh to convey and it gives information driven guidelines to the hubs should be overseen , progressively like RPC execution, ansible utilizations YAML scripting, though manikin (or) culinary specialist is worked by ruby uses their own DSL .
Q86) What is Jinja2 templating in ansible playbooks and their utilization?
Jinja2 templating is the Python standard for templating , consider it like a sed editorial manager for Ansible , where it very well may be utilized is when there is a requirement for dynamic change of any config record to any application like consider mapping a MySQL application to the IP address of the machine, where it is running, it can’t be static , it needs modifying it progressively at runtime.
Arrangement
The vars inside the  supports are supplanted by ansible while running utilizing layout module.
Q87) What is the requirement for sorting out playbooks as the job, is it vital?
Arranging playbooks as jobs , gives greater clarity and reusability to any plays , while consider an errand where MySQL establishment ought to be done after the evacuation of Oracle DB , and another prerequisite is expected to introduce MySQL after java establishment, in the two cases we have to introduce MySQL , yet without jobs need to compose playbooks independently for both use cases , yet utilizing jobs once the MySQL establishment job is made can be used any number of times by summoning utilizing rationale in site.yaml .
No, it isn’t important to make jobs for each situation, however making jobs is the best practice in Ansible.
Q88) What is the fundamental disservice of Docker holders?
As the lifetime of any compartments is while pursuing a holder is wrecked you can’t recover any information inside a compartment, the information inside a compartment is lost perpetually, however tenacious capacity for information inside compartments should be possible utilizing volumes mount to an outer source like host machine and any NFS drivers.
Q89) What are the docker motor and docker form?
Docker motor contacts the docker daemon inside the machine and makes the runtime condition and procedure for any compartment, docker make connects a few holders to shape as a stack utilized in making application stacks like LAMP, WAMP, XAMP
Q90) What are the Different modes does a holder can be run?
Docker holder can be kept running in two modes
Connected: Where it will be kept running in the forefront of the framework you are running, gives a terminal inside to compartment when – t choice is utilized with it, where each log will be diverted to stdout screen.
Isolates: This mode is typically kept running underway, where the holder is confined as a foundation procedure and each yield inside a compartment will be diverted log records inside/var/lib/docker/logs/<container-id>/<container-id.json> and which can be seen by docker logs order.
Q91) What the yield of docker assess order will be?
Docker examines <container-id> will give yield in JSON position, which contains subtleties like the IP address of the compartment inside the docker virtual scaffold and volume mount data and each other data identified with host (or) holder explicit like the basic document driver utilized, log driver utilized.
docker investigate [OPTIONS] NAME|ID [NAME|ID…] Choices
• Name, shorthand Default Description
• group, – f Format the yield utilizing the given Go layout
• measure, – s Display all out document sizes if the sort is the compartment
• type Return JSON for a predefined type
Q92) What is the order can be utilized to check the asset usage by docker holders?
Docker details order can be utilized to check the asset usage of any docker holder, it gives the yield practically equivalent to Top direction in Linux, it shapes the base for compartment asset observing instruments like a counsel, which gets yield from docker details order.
docker details [OPTIONS] [CONTAINER…] Choices
Name, shorthand Default Description
• all, – a Show all holders (default demonstrates simply running)
• group Pretty-print pictures utilizing a Go layout
• no-stream Disable spilling details and just draw the main outcome
• no-trunc Do not truncate yield
Q93) How to execute some errand (or) play on localhost just while executing playbooks on various has on an ansible?
In ansible, there is a module called delegate_to, in this module area give the specific host (or) has where your errands (or) assignment should be run.
undertakings:
name: ” Elasticsearch Hitting”
uri: url=’_search?q=status:new’ headers='{“Content-type”:”application/json”}’ method=GET return_content=yes
register: yield
delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
Q94) What is the distinction among set_fact and vars in ansible?
Where a set_fact sets the incentive for a factor at one time and stays static, despite the fact that the esteem is very powerful and vars continue changing according to the esteem continues changing for the variable.
assignments:
set_fact:
fact_time: “Truth: ”
troubleshoot: var=fact_time
order: rest 2
troubleshoot: var=fact_time
assignments:
name: queries in factors versus queries in realities
has: localhost
vars:
var_time: “Var: ”
